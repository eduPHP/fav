## Node.js RSS Reader

Study case.

What will I use?
- Node.js + express for routing
- Mysql as database maybe some ORM later
- **Not** using any lib to read RSS, I want to implement it myself
- Some sort of cache for results
- Background proccesses to update the lists

I will create an [issue](https://github.com/swalker2/node-rss-reader/issues) for any problems that I face
